# 💼 Cathy M. Dela Cruz — Virtual Administrative Assistant Resume Website

A personal resume website built as a **Prelim Exam project**, designed to help a real client stand out when applying for a remote Virtual Administrative Assistant position at a startup company in Indiana, USA.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project was created on behalf of **Cathy M. Dela Cruz**, a former Customer Service Representative from Cavite, Philippines, who is transitioning into a remote work career as a Virtual Administrative Assistant.

The goal of the website is to present Cathy's profile in a convincing, professional, and visually appealing way — bridging her 4 years of CSR experience into the VA industry through a well-designed resume website.

## 🗂️ Pages

The website contains **4 pages** navigated through a single HTML file:

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🏠 **Home** | Hero section with a quick profile card and key highlights |
| 👩 **About** | Cathy's personal story, work experience timeline, and core values |
| 🛠️ **Skills** | CSR-to-VA transferable skills table, skill proficiency bars, soft skills, and education |
| 📬 **Contact** | Contact information and a message form |

└── cathy-style.css     # All styles and responsive design
```

> ⚠️ Both files must be in the **same folder** for the website to display correctly.
